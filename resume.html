				<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
				<p class="artist-state">Two of my favorite anime shows are Afro Samurai and Samurai Champloo, these two shows are similar in the aspect that they combine Hip-Hop music and culture into anime. These creatorsâ€™ put many concepts from different fields and create something unique. One thing that inspires my work is the practice of putting many ideas into one. By having this array of different thoughts and ideas I can stitch these concepts from different grounds and use it in my pictures, programs and in my future work. I think that my greatest asset that I have in my possession is that I am able to be inspired easily in my work. Growing up in the city of New York made it possible to enhance this tool and use it to my advantage. Being exposed to many things around the city adds more imagination in my mind, I get to see a variety of graffiti and art around the city which can inspire me. There is a love and hate relationship that I have developed with the subway. There are times in which the train delays give me headaches, but through the use of music I am able to isolate myself and start thinking of new material, from a basic web design to a specific color palette. Living in the city has its perks and we should use it to our advantage, the city is vital as it has made me explore and learn new material along the way. I have to yet explore my raw ideas and make more work that is an extension of myself.</p>
